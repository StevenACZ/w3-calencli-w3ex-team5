To disable temporarily any Rubocop convention:

```
# rubocop:disable Metrics/AbcSize
def complex_and_irreducible_method(that, receive, a, lot, of, params)
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
end
# rubocop:ebable Metrics/AbcSize

# Use the convention that Rubocop is complaining about. Metrics/AbcSize is just an example.

Modify `calencli.rb`, you can work in multiple files but `calencli.rb` should be the main one.

After commit your changes, push you changes to your Github repo. Github will update your grade in each push.
